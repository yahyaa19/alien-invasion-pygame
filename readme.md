In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.

The player can move the ship left and right, using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
If any alien hits the players ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.

If the player loses three ship, the game ends.
